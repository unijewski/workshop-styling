## SASS Compilation

To compile the SCSS files use the below commands:
* `gem install sass` (in case if you don't have the gem installed)
* `sass scss/application.scss css/application.css`

Or you can use `sass --watch scss/application.scss:css/application.css` to compile all files automatically after every change.

Hint: Check out [BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io) in order to speed up your work.
